Description: Fits time-varying effect models (TVEM). These are a kind of application of varying-coefficient models in the context of longitudinal data, allowing the strength of linear, logistic, or Poisson regression relationships to change over time.  These models are described further in Tan, Shiyko, Li, Li & Dierker (2012) <doi:10.1037/a0025814>.
